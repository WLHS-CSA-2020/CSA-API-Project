# CSA API Project
 This is an Api project created by Mr George for Mr Coombs' CSA class
 Step 1: Check for Python Installation
- From the windowns cmd terminal run  >python3
    - python shell should open in terminal >>>

Step 2: Test Python's http.server
- From within this project's root directory in your terminal run
    > python3 -m http.server
- Open a web browser in the url bar enter > localhost:8000
    - You should see a GET BPI button in the browser
    - Note: crtl+c ends the http.server session


Step 3: Test it
- Press the button and see what happens

Step 4: Investigate
- Look through the html, css, and js file (no need to looks at the jquery one)
- What code is new to you?  What code is similar to java?  What pieces of the code are you not sure how it works?  FIll in the google form with specific details.
- Here is a decent list of free APIs with a wide range of topics (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) start by choosing one that doesn't use api-keys or oauth that way you don't have to sign up for anything
- Look through and try at least 3 different pulls, screenshot your results and attach them to the assignment.
